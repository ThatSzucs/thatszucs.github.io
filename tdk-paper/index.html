desired in many areas for addressing the limitations of manual labor,
increasing productivity and providing consistent quality and output.
Moreover, the advancement of technology further drives its incorporation
through reducing the costs of adaptation and enabling the automation of
an expanding range of tasks. The latter is greatly exemplified by
computer vision.</p><h3 id="computer-vision">Computer vision</h3><p>Computer vision is a rapidly growing field devoted to analyzing,
transforming and high level understanding of images <span class="citation" data-cites="pulliRealtimeComputerVision2012"><a href="#ref-pulliRealtimeComputerVision2012" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>. It is used in a diverse set of
domains: cameras can detect and focus on faces; video call applications
can blur the background to increase user privacy; programs can
transcribe text from pictures; soldering errors and missing parts can be
detected on printed circuit boards <span class="citation" data-cites="sickVisionProductCatalog halconHalconProductBrochure"><a href="#ref-sickVisionProductCatalog" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a>, <a href="#ref-halconHalconProductBrochure" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span>; faulty products can be identified

of computer vision happens at different rates across various fields.
This roots primarily in the interdisciplinary nature of this task,
requiring specialists and cross-industry collaboration. Flow chemistry
is a good example where, despite the high level of integration of
information technology, computer vision based applications are rare.</p><h3 id="flow-chemistry-and-taylor-flow">Flow chemistry and Taylor

technology that can provide an enhanced safety profile for reactions

which involve high temperatures or pressures <span class="citation" data-cites="obrienHydrogenationFlowHomogeneous2011"><a href="#ref-obrienHydrogenationFlowHomogeneous2011" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span>. Furthermore, it often facilitates

significant area <span class="citation" data-cites="liNewVoidFraction2016 croweMultiphaseFlowHandbook2005 kandlikarHeatTransferFluid2005 tibiricaFlowBoilingMicroscale2013 jiMeasurementGasLiquidTwoPhase2014"><a href="#ref-liNewVoidFraction2016" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a>, <a href="#ref-croweMultiphaseFlowHandbook2005" role="doc-biblioref">[9]</a>, <a href="#ref-kandlikarHeatTransferFluid2005" role="doc-biblioref">[10]</a>, <a href="#ref-tibiricaFlowBoilingMicroscale2013" role="doc-biblioref">[11]</a>, <a href="#ref-jiMeasurementGasLiquidTwoPhase2014" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>. One of the dominant flow regimes
(flow patterns) in such systems is the Taylor flow <span class="citation" data-cites="angeliHydrodynamicsTaylorFlow2008 guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010 hanMeasurementLiquidFilm2009"><a href="#ref-angeliHydrodynamicsTaylorFlow2008" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a>, <a href="#ref-guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a>, <a href="#ref-hanMeasurementLiquidFilm2009" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>, which consists of elongated
bubbles separated by liquid slugs (liquid plugs), as illustrated in
Figure 1. The hydrodynamic properties of the Taylor flow make it
attractive for carrying out gas-liquid operations <span class="citation" data-cites="angeliHydrodynamicsTaylorFlow2008"><a href="#ref-angeliHydrodynamicsTaylorFlow2008" role="doc-biblioref">[13]</a></span>, resulting in its usage within

critical <span class="citation" data-cites="jiMeasurementGasLiquidTwoPhase2014"><a href="#ref-jiMeasurementGasLiquidTwoPhase2014" role="doc-biblioref">[12]</a></span>. The potential for automating the

</figure><p>A British research team has developed a reactor, based on a
semi-permeable Teflon® AF-2400 membrane, which allows the advantageous
execution of catalytic hydrogenation reactions at elevated pressure in
flow within organic chemical synthesis. The device enables both the
uptake of hydrogen into the solution and the removal of it. The
quantitative measurement of the gas permeation used the traditional
burette method at first, but was later simplified with a novel computer
vision based “bubble counting” approach. The setup is depicted in Figure
2.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Hydrogen has a low solubility in the used dichloromethane (DCM)
solvent at atmospheric pressure. Therefore the amount of gas venting
from the solution downstream of the back-pressure regulator, when the
total pressure could relax to atmospheric pressure, is a reasonably
accurate measure of the gas absorbed by the flow stream in the reactor.
By adding red dye to the solvent, the gas and the liquid could be
distinguished by color. A section of tubing wrapped several times around
a frame was held in place in the view of a camera. Using a calibration
photo and basic image processing, approximating the concentration of
hydrogen was reduced to counting the number of red and white pixels, as
seen in Figure 3.</p><figure>

placed under computer control, the measurement can be fully automated.
Such bubble counting application can facilitate the measurement of gas
inlet system efficiency and equilibrium gas solubility data on a wide
range of substances, while being simpler and faster to carry out than
many currently available methods <span class="citation" data-cites="battinoSolubilityGasesLiquids1966 doancongminhTotalPressureMethod1973 turnerMeasuringVaporLiquid1996 tanRapidMeasurementGas2010"><a href="#ref-battinoSolubilityGasesLiquids1966" role="doc-biblioref">[17]</a>, <a href="#ref-doancongminhTotalPressureMethod1973" role="doc-biblioref">[18]</a>, <a href="#ref-turnerMeasuringVaporLiquid1996" role="doc-biblioref">[19]</a>, <a href="#ref-tanRapidMeasurementGas2010" role="doc-biblioref">[20]</a></span>.</p><p>However, the approach has certain limitations: it relies on a
colorful dye, requires a long tube section (1.54 m), stops and waits for
the flow to relax before taking the pictures and can only directly
measure the concentration of hydrogen. My goal was to create an
application that can overcome these limitations and effectively measure
the volume of passing gas in small-channel gas-liquid two-phase flow
systems operating in the Taylor flow regime.</p><h2 id="developing-the-application">Developing the application</h2><p>The development of the application was an iterative process, during
which the experimental setup and the program evolved side by side. The
setup enabled the recording of videos and reference values, supporting
the evaluation of a diverse set of approaches and algorithms; this
evaluation, in turn, guided the refinement of the setup. The overview of
the final experimental setup, processing algorithm and implementation
are presented in the following sections.</p><h3 id="experimental-setup">Experimental setup</h3><p>In the final setup, air and deionised water were pumped separately
through two peristaltic pumps (1.2 ml/min individual flow rate) into a
common tube. This tube passed through the video recording section to a
burette. (The pumps and burette were regular lab equipment, their
operation described in detail within my paper.) The videos were captured
in a resolution of 1280x720 pixels and 50 frames per second (fps) using
a Canon EOS 70D camera equipped with Canon EF-S 60mm f/2.8 USM lens. The
configuration is illustrated in Figure 4.</p><figure>
<img alt="Figure 4: The experimental setup." src="experimental-setup.png"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><strong>Figure 4:</strong> The
experimental setup.</figcaption>
</figure><p>The video recording section had an effective length of 7 cm and was
constructed from a backlight source, a plastic ruler, a heat-resistant
circular glass tube and pieces of black paper. The backlight was
crucial: it provided consistent lighting conditions that eliminated
shadows and other environmental noises, while also enhancing the
visibility of the examined tube section. The plastic ruler acted as the
reference, enabling the conversion of length between pixels and
millimeters. The heat-resistant circular glass tube provided a fully
transparent and mechanically stable tube section. The latter was
important as, at low flow rates, the pulsating nature of the peristaltic
pumps would make a flexible pipe move. The internal diameters of the
tested tubes were 2.8 mm, 3.95 mm, 4.8 mm, and 8 mm, respectively. The
channel width of 8 mm was too big for the Taylor flow to form. Regarding
the others, two observations were made. Firstly, the bigger the diameter
is, the more visible the phase boundaries could be made. Secondly, the
smaller the diameter is, the more rotationally symmetrical the bubbles
become. (The ends of a bubble can bend upward in a horizontal tube.) The
tube with the diameter of 3.95 mm provided a good compromise and was
chosen for the final setup. Lastly, pieces of black paper were laid
parallel to the tube for enhancing the contrast of the phase boundaries.
While analyzing some recordings, it was observed that as the bubbles are
passing along an object near the tube, its reflection appears in the
border of the bubble. This turned out to be a cornerstone of the
application: the bubble-edges could be darkened and made easily visible.

recording.</figcaption>
</figure><h3 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h3><p>The processing algorithm tasked with calculating the volume of the
gas consisted of three main sections: the location, the tracking and the
measurement of the gas bubbles.</p><p>The bubble location built on the gas-boundary darkening technique of
the experimental setup. Using a reference image taken of the
water-filled recording section, the bubble outlines could be located
with grayscale image differencing. To ensure having one contiguous
contour per bubble, the fragmented outlines could be united with image
processing techniques such as thresholding and morphology; this is
demonstrated in Figure 6.</p><figure>

extreme case. The steps include greyscale differencing, binary
thresholding, dilating and hit-or-miss transformations with multiple
kernels. The final thinning operation is merely shown to demonstrate the
unification of the boundary, and is not used otherwise.
</figcaption>
</figure><p>Using the spatial overlap of the areas outlined by the contours
across consecutive video frames, the bubbles could be identified and
tracked. The contours on the new frame with no suitable overlaps with
already tracked objects belong to newly sighted objects, while tracked
objects without suitable overlaps on the new frame do disappear. This
overlap-based approach would also be capable of handling the bubbles
splitting up and merging together, had it been necessary.</p><p>The gas volume measurement relied on the assumption that the
elongated gas bubbles could be approximated as cylinders with
half-spheres at their ends. (This is backed up by <span class="citation" data-cites="guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010"><a href="#ref-guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span> for low capillary numbers, although
it was noticed only when writing this summary.) The volume of a bubble,
therefore, would be equal to the volume of a cylinder of equal height,
minus a calibration value due to the ends. The diameter of a bubble can
be approximated with the diameter of the glass tube. The length can be
estimated with the width of the smallest enclosing rectangle when the
entire bubble is visible, as shown in Figure 7. (The bubble is fully
visible when there is sufficient distance between its border and the
sections at which it enters and exits the field of view.) The
calibration value can be calculated from reference measurements.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Lastly, two noise filtering techniques must be discussed. The
experimental setup and the bubble location together could eliminate the
majority of the environmental noises. However, in extreme cases, such as
when the experimental setup was bumped into or when the pieces of black
paper were moved during recording, the contours of the disturbances
could be retrieved throughout the duration of the disruption. To prevent
measuring errors, these were filtered in two stages. The contours with
an insignificant area were discarded before the bubble tracking.
Afterwards, every tracked object was assigned a lifetime value, which is
the metric of how many frames the object has been tracked for. By
selecting an appropriate lifetime threshold for measuring the volume,
the short lived noises would disappear before mistakenly being
assessed.</p><h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3><p>The program itself consisted of two main phases: the initialization
and the processing. The initialization phase included the selection of
the source video, then the setup of the reference image, reference
distance and the region of interest (ROI). These were kept as manual
steps to simplify the code. Afterwards, the program processes each frame
by locating, tracking and measuring the bubbles. When finished with the
video, the application saves the results and exits.</p><p>The implementation used C++ using OpenCV and Visual Studio on
Windows. To facilitate the development, multiple quality of life
features were added. This includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with
video controls and data visualization, a terminal display showing the
calibration data and processing times, the ability to record the results
in video and text formats, and a tool for creating and visualizing
simple computer vision pipelines at runtime. To increase the
performance, the graphical and terminal displays were managed by their
own process. See Figure 8 for a snapshot of the GUI.</p><figure>

</img></figure><h2 id="testing">Testing</h2><p>To assess the real-life usability of the application, both its
real-time processing capability and its volume measuring accuracy had to
be evaluated.</p><h3 id="real-time-constraints">Real-time constraints</h3><p>The real-time processing capability was defined in our case as the
ability to determine the volume of passing gas within the examined tube
section with negligible delay. This constraint can be fulfilled by
either processing each frame before the next one becomes available or by
being able to skip over frames without affecting the final result of the
measurement.</p><p>To assess the performance of the application, a test consisting of
processing videos with the region of interest limited to the tube was
conducted. According to the logged time results, each frame of the video
could be processed within a maximum of 12 milliseconds, which is within
the available 20 millisecond time frame provided by the 50 fps videos.
(For more details, see Figure 9 and Figure 10.) The test was run on a
Lenovo W520 laptop equipped with an Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU, 16GB of
DDR3 RAM and an Intel i7-2670QM CPU.</p><figure>

</img></figure><p>In the tests afterwards, the robustness of the application was judged
through its measuring precision when only every n-th frame is
accessible. By carrying out the tests, it was found that processing only
every n-th (n = 1 … 10) frame of the video had no significant effect on
the measured volume. Thus the videos could be evaluated even with an
effective refresh rate of 5 fps. (Note that the lifetime threshold for
measuring the volume of a bubble had to be adjusted.) Bigger n-s were
not tested.</p><h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3><p>To evaluate whether the application can be a substitute for the
manual burette method, the measuring accuracy had to be determined for
both. This required the consideration of what errors and to what degree
affect the result and whether they are systematic or random.</p><p>The reference values were measured with an A class burette,
calibrated at 20 ˚C, with a capacity of 10 ml, division of 0.1 ml and
tolerance of ±0.03 ml. Despite the Schellbach stripe, the reading
uncertainty was estimated to be ±0.03 ml. By evening out the fluid
levels of the burette and of the other container, the read volume values
could be used directly without any conversions. Given that the
circulated deionised water was stored in an open tank, it could be
assumed to be fully saturated with air. The setup and the substances
were stored at 23 ˚C in the same room; as this likely caused the same
error in the reference and in the video measurements, it was disregarded
for both. After taking everything into consideration, the uncertainty of
the reference burette measurements was evaluated to be ±0.06 ml.</p><p>Regarding the video measurement, several factors of uncertainty were
collected. For most of them, however, the magnitude of uncertainty was
deemed to be negligible. The distortion of the used camera lens was
reported to be maximum 0.1% <span class="citation" data-cites="silberLensTestCanon2008 olechCanonEFS602009 schroiffCanonEFS60mm2010 CanonEFS60mm"><a href="#ref-silberLensTestCanon2008" role="doc-biblioref">[21]</a>, <a href="#ref-olechCanonEFS602009" role="doc-biblioref">[22]</a>, <a href="#ref-schroiffCanonEFS60mm2010" role="doc-biblioref">[23]</a>, <a href="#ref-CanonEFS60mm" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></span> and thus
there was no need for the camera calibration. The uncertainty of the
reference lengths was minimized through selecting the two furthest marks
of the ruler as reference points. The thin film of water between the
bubbles and the glass tube was reported to be in the order of 4 μm for
the equipment and materials used in the setup <span class="citation" data-cites="hanMeasurementLiquidFilm2009"><a href="#ref-hanMeasurementLiquidFilm2009" role="doc-biblioref">[15]</a></span>; this value had an insignificant
effect on the final measured volumes, and thus was discarded. For the
same reason, the error of the glass tube diameter was also ignored. The
uncertainty deriving from the pressure drop was also discarded, as
neither the short tube section, the relatively low flow-rates, nor the
horizontal tube placement would warrant pressures to significantly
differ from atmospheric pressure. The parallax-error of the
bubble-border determination was deemed to be negligible: based on
evaluating the recordings, the lengths of the bubbles did not change
significantly throughout their stay in view. Afterall, the primary
source of uncertainty was deemed to originate from the - yet unaccounted
- hemispherical ends of the bubbles.</p><p>To calibrate the length-based volume-measuring technique, the final
recordings were split into calibration and test groups. The
bubble-correction value for one video can be calculated from the
uncalibrated measurement, the reference volume and the number of
bubbles. (With the used channel diameter, both ends of a bubble were
round; had the 2.8 mm tube been used, only the front would have been.)
By doing so for each member of the calibration group, the average
bubble-correction value can be determined. This enables the calibration
of every measurement and the evaluation of the errors. The results are
summarized in Figure 11 and Table 1.</p><figure>

<strong>Table 1:</strong> Measurement data summary. The videos with the
IDs 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 belong to the calibration group. The rest
belong to the test group.
</figcaption>
</figure><p>Given the relatively low number of data points, the assessment of
uncertainty is somewhat constrained. Certain techniques, such as
calculating confidence intervals, identifying outlying data points and
fitting trend lines or curves, produce results that lack statistical
significance and therefore are not applicable. Nevertheless, the results
show that the accuracy of the video based volume measurement is at most
an order of magnitude below that of the manual burette method.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>In my paper I discuss the development of an application that uses
computer vision to measure the volume of passing gas in small-channel
flow systems operating in the gas-liquid Taylor flow regime. The
implementation and evaluation relied on videos and reference values
taken with a self-assembled experimentation setup; its design is also
discussed in detail.</p><p>Using C++ with OpenCV, the bubbles were located through grayscale
image differencing, their contours were enhanced with thresholding and
morphology, and they were tracked across consecutive frames using a
spatial overlap based technique. The measurement of their volume assumed
that a bubble can be approximated with a cylinder of equal length minus
a correction value due to the hemispherical bubble ends. To acquire this
value and to evaluate the measuring accuracy, the recordings were split
into calibration and test groups. Using the members of the former, the
average correction value was determined; this enabled the calibration of
the measurements and the calculation of the errors.</p><p>Based on the conducted tests, the application is able to robustly
process the videos in real-time. Through evaluating the measurements,
the uncertainty of the volume measurement was evaluated to be at most
one order of magnitude greater than that of the manual burette method.
Nonetheless, further measurements would enable the determination of the
accuracy with a greater certainty.</p><h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2><p>The presented application has the potential for further improvements
and use cases. These are discussed in the following sections.</p><h3 id="experimental-setup-variations">Experimental setup
variations</h3><p>The experimental setup circulated air and deionised water, and the
recordings were taken of a circular glass tube with an inner diameter of
3.95 mm. The circulated substances were chosen due to their
availability, non-toxicity and ease of handling, which enabled the
conduction of experiments without any additional training or special
equipment. The recordings were constrained to one tube diameter due to
time limitations. Consequently, the practical usability of the
application could be further evaluated if other gas-liquid substances
common in flow systems and glass tubes of various diameters (and even of
different cross sections) were also to be tested.</p><h3 id="improving-the-accuracy">Improving the accuracy</h3><p>The uncertainty of the video-based volume measurement was estimated
to be at most one order of magnitude higher than that of the manual
burette method. Nonetheless, this could be improved.</p><p>First of all, increasing the number of measurements would enable the
calculation of confidence intervals, the identification of outlying data
points and the analysis of the error distribution. These would support
the evaluation of the measurement uncertainty with a higher
confidence.</p><p>Additionally, the measurement itself could also be improved. The
experimental setup had the shortcomings of being only able to produce
bubbles with homogenous lengths and being able to measure only the total
volume of the gas and not that of the individual bubbles. By injecting
the air manually into the system with a syringe (as illustrated in
Figure 12), it would be possible to create bubbles with the desired
lengths or volumes. This, in turn, allows the evaluation of bubble
attributes on a much wider scale, promoting the improvement of the
volume-measuring technique.</p><figure>

sizes.</figcaption>
</img></figure><h3 id="further-uses">Further uses</h3><p>The application measured the volume of the passing gas within the
flow system. However, with minor modifications it could be adapted for
additional purposes.</p><p>First of all, using a reference image taken of the recording section
filled with air - instead of water - would enable the location of the
liquid slugs. Ultimately, this may enable the volume of the passing
liquid to be measured in a similar manner as it was presented for the
gas.</p><p>More importantly, however, locating the phase boundaries can also
enable the evaluation of the bubble and slug lengths, the bubble
velocity and the void fraction (the fraction of the flow domain occupied
by the gas phase <span class="citation" data-cites="guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010"><a href="#ref-guptaTaylorFlowMicrochannels2010" role="doc-biblioref">[14]</a></span>) - with the same device. This could
simplify the online monitoring of flow properties in small-channel flow
systems operating in the gas-liquid Taylor flow regime.</p><h2 class="unnumbered" id="references">References</h2><div class="references csl-bib-body" data-entry-spacing="0" id="refs" role="list">
